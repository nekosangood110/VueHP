## About
This is a SPA portfolio site created with Vue.js. Vue Router was used to implement the SPA, and Firebase was used to implement the contact form (email sending function). Vuetify is used as the library.

## Language & Technology used
Vue.js/Vue Router/Vuetify/Firebase

## ingenious
We designed the site to be eye-catching on the first view by placing text animations.


I'm having a lot of fun with Vue.js, so I'd like to keep learning and create more works in the future.
I would like to thank you for reading this far. Thank you very much.:laughing:
